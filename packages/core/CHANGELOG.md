# @effex/core

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 2a730e7: Wire up `stagger` for `each`'s enter animations. `stagger` was declared on `ListAnimationOptions` and exported via helpers (`stagger`, `staggerFromCenter`) but nothing in the runtime consumed it, so `each({ animate: { stagger: stagger(40) } })` produced no visible staggering. The API had been advertising the feature without implementing it.

  Now `reconcile` captures a `staggerStartAt` timestamp when a batch begins and threads it plus `totalItems` through to each slot's animation. `forkSlotEnter` computes the target fire time as `startAt + stagger(index, total)` and delays only the residual after reconcile overhead — so item N always fires at the same wall-clock moment regardless of how long reconcile takes to iterate to slot N. Without the shared reference, per-slot delays would compound and each item would drift further behind its expected position.

  Applies to `each` (client, client-fallback-during-hydration, hydration-root, and intro re-animation paths). `when` / `match` / etc. don't take a stagger option — they render single elements.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c68479: Initial public release of Effex - a reactive UI framework built on Effect.

  **@effex/core**
  - Signal: Mutable reactive values with equality-based updates
  - Derived: Computed values that automatically track dependencies
  - Readable: Base interface for reactive values with `get`, `changes`, `values`, and `map`
  - Readable.combine: Combine multiple Readables into a tuple
  - Readable.lift: Lift functions to accept Readable arguments (great for CVA, clsx)

  **@effex/dom**
  - Element factories (`$.div`, `$.button`, etc.) with reactive attributes
  - Control flow: `when`, `match`, `each` with animation support
  - Boundary.suspense for async loading states
  - Template literals (`t`) for reactive strings
  - Portal for rendering outside the component tree
  - CSS-first animations with stagger utilities

  **@effex/router**
  - Type-safe routing with Effect Schema validation
  - Route params as Readables
  - History API navigation
  - Link component

  **@effex/form**
  - Schema-based validation with Effect Schema
  - Field-level state (value, errors, touched, dirty)
  - Configurable validation timing
  - Async validators support
